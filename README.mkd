Ports
=====

This is my collection of additions and updates to [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/):

 1. nodejs

Using These Ports

 1. Get the code and generate the `Portindex`:

    $ cd
    $ git clone git://github.com/dabio/ports.git
    $ make -C ports

 2. Add this line to MacPorts' `/opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf`. Make sure itâ€™s *before* the `[default]` source.

    file:///Users/your-username/ports

 3. Sync:

    $ sudo port sync

At this point, you should be able to install the ports:

    $ sudo port install _portname_
